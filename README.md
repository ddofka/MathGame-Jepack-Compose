# MathGame Jetpack Compose

Project 2 of the Udemy course

This game features main screen where you are be able to choose between
different math to do f.e addition, division. Second screen is where you will do the math.
This includes bar with life count, points counter and timer. Below a math
problem to solve and below it empty field to enter solution. If you enter wrong
yuo will lose points, if you will not enter answer in specified time you will have
to go to the next problem. Game end when all life == 0. After that there is a
screen with score and two buttons for try again or exit the app.

As before I will do all of GIT commands via terminal icluding init and GitHub for
PR as safe workflow. Also this README file will be created and edited via terminal.

Project is finished with slight deviations form original. Background images and icon
was generated by Gemini A.I, edited with Affinity Studio.
