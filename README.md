# MathGame Jetpack Compose

Project 2 of the Udemy course

This game will feature main screen where you will be able to choose between
different math to do f.e division. Second screen is where you will do the challenge.
This includes bar with life count, points counter and timer. Below it a math
problem to solve and below it empty field to enter solution. If you enter wrong
yuo will lose points, if you will not enter answer in specified time you will have
to go to the next problem. Games end when all life == 0. After that there will be a
screen with score and two button for try again and exit.

As before I will do all of GIT commands via terminal icluding init and GitHub for
PR as safe worklfow. Also this README file will be created and edited via terminal.
